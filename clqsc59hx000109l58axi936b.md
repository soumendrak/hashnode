### Academic üìö

* I have completed my **M. Tech in Data Science** from BITS Pilani this November. Since 2021, all weekends have been used by this course.
    
* Resuming academics after nine years of work experience with all these side volunteering activities was inaccessible. Thanks to my wife, mentor, and manager for helping at every front.
    

There are a few setbacks as well. However, I managed to come over those. I hope 2024 will be full of excitement, new challenges, and many things to learn.
