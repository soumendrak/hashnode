I have mentioned the main questions and the ladder questions around that question under it.

### First telephonic round

1. When does the bytecode gets generated?
  - During import of the module
2. Mention a few default modules installed in Python
3. What is the significance of `__init__.py`?
4. How and Why do we use Decorators in Python?
5. What will be the output of the following statement:
    
```python
  for i in range(3):
      print(i)  
```
6. How to convert an integer to a string?
7. What is the difference between Tuples and Lists?
  - Tuples are immuatable
  - Tuples can be the key to a dictionary
  - Tuples are faster compared to Lists
8. How does memory management happen in Python (Heap structure)?
  - Reference count of each object has been maintained by Python
  - If the reference count becomes less than 1, that object gets deleted

  - MVC
11. What are `lambda` expressions?
12. Which databases have you used?
13. Did you use Unit testing? If yes, how did you implement it?

### Second round onwards

Got an email that I did not qualify.

## Verdict

**Rejected**

## Analysis

- Another rejection :(
- This time at least the discussion went on for about an hour.
- I answered most of the questions and was optimistic that I will get a second-round call. However, my answers were not good enough for them.

I have appeared in 20+ interviews so far. You can check out my [job interview series](https://blog.soumendrak.com/series/job-interview) for the rest of the interviews experiences.

Let me know if you have any further questions. Thank You.
