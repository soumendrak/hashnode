3. How to find the middle element of a linked list?

### Second round onward

You may have seen, the first round is very short and ended abruptly. Definitely, I did not get further communication for the second round. However, thanks to them that they informed me that I did not qualify for the next round.

## Verdict

**Rejected**

## My opinion

- Nvidia was a good company; it is now too. I have expected at least to clear the first round. However, this was a disaster. Worse than the [Tech Mahindra experience](https://blog.soumendrak.com/tech-mahindra-interview-experience).
- I have prepared for this unlike the previous. However, unfortunately, the questions asked and my preparation did not match. My preparation gaps were clearly visible.
- I worked on my communication skills by answering to the point with keywords and not beating around the bush on how I understood them. The goal is to communicate properly so the other person can understand.

My quest for clearing a single interview continued...

I have appeared in 20+ interviews so far. You can check out my [job interview series](https://blog.soumendrak.com/series/job-interview) for the rest of the interviews experiences.

Let me know if you have any further questions. Thank You.
