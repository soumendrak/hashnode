## Interview discussions

I have mentioned the main questions and the ladder questions around that question under it.

### First round

1. What is Class?
  - Entities of an application under development is called objects.
  - In Python, every entity is an object.
  - Class defines objects.
  - Method defines the behaviour of the class.
2. What is inheritance?
 - Inheritance is the property of OOP where
   - A class extends/inherits the methods and properties of another base class
   - It maintains the hierarchy
   - Increases reusability
3. Regex to find an IP address
4. Difference between `extend` and `append`?
5. What is Abstract class?
  - Which keeps the underlying complexities of the class away from class
6. What is dictionary comprehension
  - Like list comprehension for Dictionaries
7. What is a constructor?
  - Which constructs something
  - The `__init__` in a class
8. What is a Generator?
  - It generates in the runtime on every loop call
9. Difference between `range` and `xrange`?
- `range` is a list
-	`xrange` is a generator
-	`xrange` is `range` in Python 3
	
### Second round onwards

Did not qualify. I was weak in the OOPs concepts.

## Verdict

**Rejected**

## My opinion

- I was not fully prepared, as it was near to my Accenture office I went.
- This was my first Python interview. I want to check how in the market Python questions are being asked. 
- I got to know I have a lot to study. I was self-studying Python.

I have appeared in 20+ interviews so far. You can check out my [job interview series](https://blog.soumendrak.com/series/job-interview) for the rest of the interviews experiences.

Let me know if you have any further questions. Thank You.
