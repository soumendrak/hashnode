## What is SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)?

## Calculation

SOPR is calculated simply as (Price sold / Price bought)


## SOPR values

There are three possible values of SOPR.


1. SOPR > 1 
  - The coin holder made a profit.
  - The selling price is higher than the buying price

2. SOPR < 1
  - The coin holder made a loss.
  - Based on the formula above the selling price is lower than the buying price

3. SOPR = 1
  - The coin holder made no profit or loss.

Here is an example of ETH SOPR:

## Indication by SOPR

What does this SOPR indicate?

- In general, higher SOPR values indicate that more profit was realised that day. Successive peaks of high SOPR (creating an indicator uptrend) suggest continual distribution, usually during bullish price rallies. 
- A lower SOPR indicates fear and panic selling in the market.
