In Python, the backslash (\\) character is used for several purposes, such as:

* To specify escape sequences, like `\n` for a new line, `\t` for a tab, etc.
    
* To escape special characters - the backward slash is used to escape special characters such as quotation marks and newline characters in strings. For example:
    

```python
# escaping special characters in a string

my_string = "This is a string with a \"quotation mark\" and a newline character \n in it"
print(my_string)
```

* Split a string into multiple lines using the \\ character at the end of each line. For example, the following code will print hello world on two lines:
    

```python
# continuing a line of code

print("This is a very long line of code that cannot fit on one line" \
      "so we are using the backward slash to continue it on the next line")
```

It's important to note that in Python, the backslash character is used for escaping characters, and it is not the same as the forward-slash (/) character, which is used for division. For example, the following code will print 5.0:

```python
print(10 / 2)
```
