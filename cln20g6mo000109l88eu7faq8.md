Hello, I am the Call For Proposals Lead for [PyCon India 2023](https://in.pycon.org/2023/). My team and I have diligently managed proposals since April of this year. As we have completed our review and shortlisted our speakers, I would like to share an analysis of the proposal trends for this year's PyCon India.

## Proposal Management

I have managed proposals for Talks, Workshops, Lightning Talks, and Poster presentations. Initially, we spent a reasonable amount of time deciding on the proposal categories for this edition.

These graphs illustrate the distribution of proposals received by category from 2015 to 2023.

### PyCon India 2015 CFP distribution

### PyCon India 2019 CFP distribution

### PyCon India 2023 CFP distribution

#### AI subcategories

![Subcategories of the AI category](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694191269886/ff7e6a12-3958-4738-b936-474dcc67387f.png align="center")

We received 88 proposals, and they fell into different categories. It's interesting to note that there's a chart showing the percentage of proposals related to AI or Data Science (DS) from 2015 to previous PyCon India editions.

*Unfortunately, we don't have data for the 2021 edition, and PyCon India 2022 had to be canceled.*

![AI/DS proposals across PyCon India editions.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694194376193/ba2af824-7113-4c72-96d9-c05ba290bfab.png align="center")

During the 2018 PyConIndia, there was a surge in the number of proposals related to DS. The trend continued in 2019 when nearly half of all proposals were DS-related.

However, there has been a consistent decline in the number of DS proposals over the years. Despite DS being the category with the highest number of proposals this year, we also received a multitude of proposals from various other categories.

### PyConIn 2023 Novelty

1. Though there is a market trend on AI at its peak, we received fewer AI proposals than in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
    
2. In this edition, we have introduced a few new categories:
    
    1. Cloud Computing
        
    2. Concurrency
        
    3. Ethics and Philosophy &
        
    4. Distributed Computing
        

## Summary

In this post, we discussed various proposal categories and their trends. We have researched the Artificial Intelligence/Data Science category trend across multiple PyCon India editions.

In the next part, I will discuss more insights into the challenges and how we overcome them.
