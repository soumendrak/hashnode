## Google Street View

On 27th July 2022 Google [brought back](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-brings-street-view-to-india/article65689198.ece) street view to India, due to a reduction in Govt. security regulations.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View):

> Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that provides interactive panoramas from positions along many streets in the world. It was launched in 2007 in several cities in the United States, and has since expanded to include cities and rural areas worldwide. Streets with Street View imagery available are shown as blue lines on Google Maps.

> Google Street View displays interactively panoramas of stitched VR photographs. Most photography is done by car, but some is done by tricycle, camel, boat, snowmobile, underwater apparatus, and on foot.
