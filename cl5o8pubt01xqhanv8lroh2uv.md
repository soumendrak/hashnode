I have been trying out software since 2008. Back then, software was coming in CDs in tech magazines. After all these years, here is what I have been settling on:

## Browser

I have tried IE, Edge, Safari, Opera, Maxthon, Avant, Vivaldi, etc. I have been a Google Chrome user for a long time. A few years back, when Firefox launched Containers, I switched to Firefox.

* [Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
    
    * I use Firefox, especially for its container feature.
        
    * I contribute to the Mozilla community, so a bit of emotional attachment is there.
        
* [Brave](https://brave.com/)
    
    * Brave I use Google Input tools add-on to write into Odia Wikipedia and make [Shabdarasa](https://www.sabdarasa.com) posts in Odia.
        
    * To try out new Chromium-based Add-ons.
        

## Firefox Browser Extensions/Add-ons

### [Video Speed controller](https://github.com/codebicycle/videospeed)

* I use this to go beyond 2x speed while watching any video.
    
* The highest went till 4x speed.
    

### [Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)

* Containers are like Independent cookies-based tabs synced with your bookmarks.
    
* Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you separate parts of your online life into colour-coded tabs. Cookies are separated by the container.
    
* For example, you can open two different Twitter accounts in the same window in two different tabs.
