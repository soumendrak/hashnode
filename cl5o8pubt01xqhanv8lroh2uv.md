I have been trying out software since 2008. Back then, software was coming in CDs in tech magazines. After all these years, here is what I have been settling on:

## Browser

I have tried IE, Edge, Safari, Opera, Maxthon, Avant, Vivaldi, etc. I have been a Google Chrome user for a long time. A few years back, when Firefox launched Containers, I switched to Firefox.

* [Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
    
    * I use Firefox, especially for its container feature.
        
    * I contribute to the Mozilla community, so a bit of emotional attachment is there.
        
* [Brave](https://brave.com/)
    
    * Brave I use Google Input tools add-on to write into Odia Wikipedia and make [Shabdarasa](https://www.sabdarasa.com) posts in Odia.
        
    * To try out new Chromium-based Add-ons.

Firefox Relay helps you protect your actual email address â€” the one most closely tied to your online identity. 
* It lets you generate unique, random aliases (up to 5 in the free tier) to sign up for accounts, apps, or newsletters and forward messages to your address. If you find that an account is sending unwanted emails or spam, you can block the alias, and it will stop sending emails to your inbox. Once you no longer want an account, you can delete the alias.
