## My top browser extensions / add-ons

I have been trying out software since 2008. Back then software was coming in CDs in tech magazines. After all these years, here is what I have been settling on:

## Browser

I had tried IE, Edge, Safari, Opera, Maxthon, Avant, Vivaldi, etc. I had been a Google Chrome user for a long time. A few years back when Firefox launched Containers, I switched to Firefox.

- [Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
  - I use Firefox, especially for its container feature.
  - I am a contributor to the Mozilla community, so a bit of emotional attachment is there.
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
  - Brave I use to use Google Input tools add-on to write into Odia Wikipedia and to make [Shabdarasa](https://www.sabdarasa.com) posts in Odia.
  - To try out new Chromium-based Add-ons.
