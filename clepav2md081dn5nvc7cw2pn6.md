The first time I heard this term I thought of it as a relationship term where couples do not trust each other. However, in the tech industry, it has a different meaning altogether. Naming things always have been a challenge and people are being creative to name things which have different meanings altogether for the common man. What do you think about the terms Zookeeper, Rust, Python, Anaconda, Jupyter, etc.

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes that all users, devices, and network traffic are potential threats, and therefore, it requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to connect to a network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of the network perimeter. In a Zero Trust environment, users are not automatically trusted and must be authenticated and authorized before they can access any resources. This approach also involves the continuous monitoring of devices and user behaviour, and the use of encryption and least-privilege access policies to limit the potential damage of any security breaches.

The Zero Trust model is based on the principle that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside their perimeters. They should verify anything and everything that tries to connect to their systems before granting access. This approach can help organizations prevent data breaches and cyber-attacks. It can also minimize the damage caused by those incidents, as it limits the attacker's ability to move laterally across the network.

To take care of this industry is having a new CxO role called [CZTO (Chief Zero Trust Officer)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/chief-zero-trust-officer/). Let's see how it unfolds.

In summary, Zero Trust is a security model that provides a comprehensive approach to securing modern networks, applications, and data, by assuming that all users, devices, and network traffic are potential risks, and it requires strict identity verification and continuous monitoring to prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks.
