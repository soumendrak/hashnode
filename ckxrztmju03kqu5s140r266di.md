It was a pen paper-based exam, no computer was there. The discussion was more focused on solving RegEx-based problems.

1. Regex for credit card number detection
  - You can check [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/33227309/5014656) for answers.
2. Real-life use cases of decorator
  - Provided example of [login_required](https://www.fullstackpython.com/django-contrib-auth-decorators-login-required-examples.html) decorator in Django
3. Reversal of a list not using split or any function
  - Explained the following example
    ```python
    my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    my_reversed_list = my_list[::-1]
    ```
4. IP address validation using regex

5. Code to find out how many vowels are there in a string
  - You can check [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25885108/5014656).

## 🤔Analysis

- It was a walk-in and many candidates were there, more than 50.
- The interview process was not well structured and could have been improved.
- I did not expect the discussions will be so much concentrated on RegEx, though I had the basic knowledge of RegEx I was not able to come up with solutions at that time.

I have appeared in 20+ interviews so far. You can check out my [job interview series](https://blog.soumendrak.com/series/job-interview) for the rest of the interviews experiences.

Let me know if you have any further questions. Thank You 🙏🏼
