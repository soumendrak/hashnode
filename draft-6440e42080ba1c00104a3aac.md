## Introduction

2019 I was one of the CFP (Call For Proposal) reviewers at PyCon(Python Conference) India 2019, Chennai. If you want to learn about my experience there, check out my article on [The Inside Story of How We Selected 30 Talks from 280+ Proposals for Pycon India 2019](https://blog.soumendrak.com/pycon-india-cfp-review).

Post-2019 edition, PyCon India is back to the offline conference in 2023, and Soumendra also returns as a volunteer. For the 2023 edition, I have volunteered to be the CFP lead. We will briefly discuss the pre-event timeline.

## Timeline

This is an overall timeline of the entire CFP process. Before volunteering at PyCon, in my wildest dreams, I would have never thought that preparation needed to start 7-8 months before an event started.

| 22 May | CFP Opens |
| 28 May | [Dr.Murali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muralidharan-murugesan-050a4727/) was selected as Co-lead of CFP WG. |

## Initial days üí°

* I joined as CFP Lead and core member for the PyCon India 2023 on 7 Apr 2023.
    
* I shared a [CFP best practices](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction/wiki/CFP-Reviewer-best-practices) written by previous organizers in 2019. I have also modified this guide down the lane based on the need. Future PyCon CFP reviewers can use this guide.
    
* On a Sunday evening, on 16 Apr, I organized the first CFP Reviewers meeting.
    
* Around 25 volunteers joined on call that evening.
    

## Reviewer Management ü™Ñ

As a CFP lead, you understand the importance of managing reviewers. This task is second only to managing proposals, which is the top priority. Your role includes motivating volunteers to review, being empathetic, and ensuring work is completed throughout the five-month process. You can inspire your team to achieve great results with your dedication and guidance.

In corporate, it is easier to lead people; I have managed ten to fifteen people before. However, managing volunteers who are not liable to do your work and work gets done only on a volunteering basis without any compensation is a challenge.

### Reviewers dropout üò≠

On analysis, the reviewers left because of one of the following:

1. Few are curious individuals who want to know how PyCon works and are not serious about contributing to the event.
    
2. As a Reviewer, one cannot submit a proposal to avoid bias in the review process. This caused many to leave.
    
3. It is a thankless and tiring job; you will spend 30-45 minutes per proposal to evaluate. Focus, dedication, and perseverance are required to be a reviewer.
    
4. There are no free tickets as a volunteer to the conference and no additional facility you will receive as a volunteer.
    
5. Even if they want to, other commitments make them deprioritize this volunteering activity.
    
6. Maybe they do not like the CFP lead ü´£
    

This issue is common across Wikipedia, Mozilla, and other volunteer-driven projects I contribute to.

The trend of the number of attendees in the weekly call of the CFP workgroup.

75+ volunteers signed up to be a reviewer. Twenty-five joined on the first call, and by the end of five months, there were around six left.

A positive aspect of volunteer-led initiatives is that those who remain committed until the end are typically highly motivated, often surpassing expectations by ten to one hundred times. They will likely exceed expectations even further by respecting their opinions and granting them autonomy.

## Proposals Management üìí

To know more about the proposal category trends across previous editions, please follow my blog post, [PyCon India 2023 Proposals Analysis (](https://blog.soumendrak.com/an-analysis-of-pycon-india-2023-proposals)[soumendrak.com](http://soumendrak.com)[)](https://blog.soumendrak.com/an-analysis-of-pycon-india-2023-proposals).

Once the Junction tool is ready with data backup of previous editions and category &lt;&gt; reviewer mapping.

There is a spike of proposals towards the first deadline, i.e., 5 Aug. Then a slight spike in the final deadline, i.e., 15 Aug.

Initially, I was a bit unhappy that with only three days left, we got around 150 proposals, which is half of the proposals we received in 2019. However, due to aggressive promotion from all the social media handles and local chapters, we received 23 proposals on 4 Aug and 53 proposals ü§Ø on 5 Aug, which was quite overwhelming., However, we could not break the number of proposals milestone of 2019.

## Tools and Technologies ‚öíÔ∏è

This Section is for you if you are a future PyCon India or any other conference organizer. Thanks to the following tools which helped us make the conference possible.

1. [Junction](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction): A Django-based web application for proposals and reviewer management.
    
2. [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/): A free web and mobile app to start and join meetings.
    
3. [Zoho Mail](https://mail.zoho.in/): A free mailbox to send and receive emails with a custom domain like *cfp@in.pycon.org*, *tickets@in.pycon.org or contact@in.pycon.org*.
    
4. [GitHub Project Manager](https://github.com/orgs/pythonindia/projects/3): We have used the GitHub project manager to manage the workgroup tasks.
    
5. Google Docs: For Agenda, MoM, and further free-flowing text-related documents, we have used Google Docs extensively.
    
6. Google Sheets: We have used Google Sheets extensively from day 1 to manage the proposals, categorize and classify them, etc.
    
7. Google Forms: We have used Google Forms to get reviewer, proposer, and speaker inputs at different phases of the conference.
    
8. [Netlify](https://netlify.com/): We have used Netlify for PR review and our blog and website deployment.
    
9. NextJS: We have used Next.js for the main website.
    
10. [Calendly](https://calendly.com/): For speaker rehearsal slot booking.
    

## Lessons Learnt üìã

In these seven months, I learned many things:

1. I will do it if I have committed to delivering task A, which significantly impacts other human beings. It does not matter if I am getting paid for it or not. It does not matter if I get support from others or not.
    
2. For the CFP workgroup, I tried to manage most of the tasks asynchronously over Zulip and WhatsApp rather than frequent meetings where all participants needed to meet. During the later parts, I made weekly calls and took asynchronous updates from reviewers. Too many synchronous meetings (every participant needs to be there simultaneously) are for people with poor written communication skills, lack of motivation, or less accountability.
    
3. I should have divided the proposals and assigned them to individuals to review rather than asking them to pick up from their preferred category. Often, people want to get specific tasks, and someone else takes care of the bigger picture.
    

## Acknowledgment

I want to thank the [other workgroup leads](https://web.archive.org/web/20231002020435/https://in.pycon.org/2023/volunteers/workgroup-leads/) and volunteers for doing their responsibilities to make this conference possible. I thank the platform lead, [Ananyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maitiananyo/), who resolved all the Junction issues within 24 hours to unblock the CFP team.

## Conclusion

I volunteered for this edition of PyCon for

a) PyCon India is back to the offline conference after a gap of 4 years,  
b) I wouldn't say I liked that PyCon India did not happen last year in 2022 for the first time since its inception in 2009.  
c) There is a high chance that this may be my last PyCon India due to a few personal reasons.

On the, days of the event, I have contributed to the registration desk session monitor/chair at various tracks. Maybe I will share those experiences in another post.

In this post, we discussed the overall process of the CFP workgroup since its inception and the challenges faced in between.
