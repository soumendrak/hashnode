## Introduction

In 2019 I was one of the CFP (Call For Proposal) reviewers at PyCon(Python Conference) India 2019, Chennai. If you want to learn about my experience there, check out my article on [The Inside Story of How We Selected 30 Talks from 280+ Proposals for Pycon India 2019](https://blog.soumendrak.com/pycon-india-cfp-review).

As the 2019 PyCon is finally back for an offline conference in 2023, I have approached the conference chair, [Sanchit Balchandani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inovizz/); if he needs any help reviewing proposals, I can help. He was kind enough to make me the lead of the CFP workgroup this time.

## Initial days

* I joined as CFP Lead and core member for the PyCon India 2023 on the 7th of April 2023.
    
* I shared a [CFP best practices](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction/wiki/CFP-Reviewer-best-practices) written by previous organizers. I have also modified this guide down the lane based on the need. Future PyCon CFP reviewers can use this guide.
    
* On a Sunday evening, on the 16th of April, I organized the first CFP Reviewers meeting.
    
* Around 25 volunteers joined on call that evening.
    

## Reviewer Management

Reviewer management was the second most important task for a CFP lead. Getting volunteers to review, keeping them motivated throughout five months, being empathetic simultaneously, and ensuring the work is getting done.

In corporate life, it is easier to lead people; I have managed ten to fifteen people before. However, managing volunteers who are not liable to do your work and work get done only on a volunteering basis without any compensation is a challenge.

This issue is common across Wikipedia, Mozilla, and other volunteer-driven projects.

The trend of the number of attendees in the weekly call of the CFP workgroup.

75+ volunteers signed up to be a reviewer. Twenty-five joined on the first call, and by the end of five months, there were around six left.

## Proposal Management

I have managed Talks, Workshops, Devsprint, and Poster presentation proposals. In the initial days, we have spent a reasonable amount of time deciding on the categories of the proposals we plan to receive in this edition.  
In this edition, we have introduced a few new categories:

1. Cloud Computing
    
2. Concurrency
    
3. Ethics and Philosophy &
    
4. Distributed Computing
    

Here are a few graphs to showcase the distribution of proposals received across different categories in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2023.

1. PyCon India 2023 CFP distribution

7.1. AI subcategories

![Subcategories of the AI category](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694191269886/ff7e6a12-3958-4738-b936-474dcc67387f.png align="center")

Out of the 88 AI proposals received, this is the distribution subcategories of the proposals.

Here is an interesting chart of the percentage of AI or Data science related proposals throughout the editions of PyCon India since 2015.

Unfortunately, I do not have 2021 edition data, and in 2022, PyCon India was cancelled.

![AI/DS proposals across PyCon India editions.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694194376193/ba2af824-7113-4c72-96d9-c05ba290bfab.png align="center")

In the 2018 edition, PyConIn received the highest number of Data science proposals. In the 2019 edition, almost half of the proposals were Data science related. However, DS proposals have been constantly on a downtrend for a few years. This year though DS is the highest-received proposal category, we got many diverse proposals across other categories.

### PyConIn 2023 Unique observations

1. Though there is a market trend on AI at its peak, we received fewer AI proposals than in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
    

## Tools and Technologies used

This section is for you if you are a future PyCon India or any other conference organizer. Thanks to the following tools which helped us make the conference possible.

1. [Junction](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction): A Django-based web application for proposals and reviewer management.
    
2. [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/): A free web and mobile app to start and join meetings.
    
3. [Zoho Mail](https://mail.zoho.in/): A free mailbox to send and receive emails with a custom domain like *cfp@in.pycon.org*.
    
4. [GitHub Project Manager](https://github.com/orgs/pythonindia/projects/3): We have used the GitHub project manager to manage the workgroup tasks.
    
5. Google Docs: For Agenda, MoM, and further free-flowing text-related documents, we have used Google Docs extensively.
    
6. Google Sheets: We have used Google Sheets extensively from day 1 to manage the proposals, categorize and classify them, etc.
    
7. Google Forms: We have used Google Forms to get reviewer, proposer, and speaker inputs at different phases of the conference.
    
8. Netlify: We have used Netlify for PR review and our blog and website deployment.
    
9. NextJS: We have used Next.js for the main website.
    

## Conclusion

I volunteered for this edition of PyCon for a) PyCon India is back to the offline conference, and b) I wouldn't say I liked that 2022 PyCon did not happen for the first time since its inception in 2009.
