## Introduction

I was one of the CFP (Call For Proposal) reviewers at [PyCon (Python Conference) India 2019, Chennai](https://in.pycon.org/2019/). If you want to learn about my experience there, check out my article on [The Inside Story of How We Selected 30 Talks from 280+ Proposals for Pycon India 2019](https://blog.soumendrak.com/pycon-india-cfp-review).

Post-2019 edition, PyCon India is back to the offline conference in 2023, and Soumendra also returns as a volunteer. For the 2023 edition, I have volunteered to be the CFP lead. We will briefly discuss the pre-event timeline.

## Timeline

This is an overall timeline of the entire CFP process.  
Before volunteering at PyCon, in my wildest dreams, I would have never thought that preparation needed to start 7-8 months before an event started.

| Date (2023) | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 7 Apr | I joined as CFP Lead in the Core group of PyCon India. |
| 16 Apr | 1st CFP volunteer's meeting |
| 7 May | Finalized the categories on which we will receive the proposals. |
| 22 May | CFP Opens |
| 28 May | [Dr.Murali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muralidharan-murugesan-050a4727/) was selected as Co-lead of CFP WG. |
| 5 Aug | The initial deadline for Talks and Workshop CFP |
| 15 Aug | Extended deadline ends; CFP closes |
| 3 Sep | Workshop proposals shortlisted |
| 6 Sep | Talk proposals shortlisted |

## Terms & Definitions

These terms will help you understand this post better.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CFP | Call For Proposals |
| [Junction](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/) | A Django-based web app for CFP management |
| PyCon | Country-level **Py**thon **Con**ference |
| PyConf | City-level low scaled **Py**thon **Conf**erence |
| Talk Category | Category or Section of a proposal like *Core Python* or *Blockchain* |
| WG | Workgroup: it's a team. |

## Initial days üí°

* I joined as CFP Lead and core member for the PyCon India 2023 on 7 Apr 2023.
    
* I shared a [CFP best practices](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction/wiki/CFP-Reviewer-best-practices) written by previous organizers in 2019. I have also modified this guide down the lane based on the need. Future PyCon CFP reviewers can use this guide.
    
* On a Sunday evening, on 16 Apr, I organized the first CFP Reviewers meeting.
    
* Around 25 volunteers joined the call that evening.
    

## Reviewer Management ü™Ñ

As a CFP lead, you understand the importance of managing reviewers. This task is second only to managing proposals, which is the top priority. Your role includes motivating volunteers to review, being empathetic, and ensuring work is completed throughout the five-month process. You can inspire your team to achieve great results with your dedication and guidance.

In corporate, it is easier to lead people; I have managed ten to fifteen people before. However, managing volunteers who are not liable to do your work and work gets done only on a volunteering basis without any compensation is a challenge.

### Reviewers drop üò≠

On analysis, the reviewers left because of one of the following:

1. Few are curious individuals who want to know how PyCon works and are not serious about contributing to the event.
    
2. As a Reviewer, one cannot submit a proposal to avoid bias in the review process. This caused many to leave.
    
3. It is a thankless and tiring job; you will spend 30-45 minutes per proposal to evaluate. Focus, dedication, and perseverance are required to be a reviewer.
    
4. There are no free tickets as a volunteer to the conference and no additional facility you will receive as a volunteer.
    
5. Even if they want to, other commitments make them deprioritize this volunteering activity.
    
6. Maybe they do not like the CFP lead ü´£
    

This issue is common across Wikipedia, Mozilla, and other volunteer-driven projects I contribute to.

![a line graph showing the number of volunteers vs date](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694186297186/fb151871-f3ee-48f9-b872-ca1676aae7d6.png align="center")

*The trend of the number of attendees in the weekly call of the CFP workgroup.*

75+ volunteers signed up to be a reviewer. Twenty-five joined on the first call, and by the end of five months, there were around six left.

A positive aspect of volunteer-led initiatives is that those who remain committed until the end are typically highly motivated, often surpassing expectations by ten to one hundred times. They will likely exceed expectations even further by respecting their opinions and granting them autonomy.

## Proposals Management üìí

To know more about the proposal category trends across previous editions, please follow my blog post, [PyCon India 2023 Proposals Analysis (](https://blog.soumendrak.com/an-analysis-of-pycon-india-2023-proposals)[soumendrak.com](http://soumendrak.com)[)](https://blog.soumendrak.com/an-analysis-of-pycon-india-2023-proposals).

Once the Junction tool is ready with data backup of previous editions and Category &lt;&gt; Reviewer mapping.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1696356177782/f9db40e5-699e-4021-897f-63c9450b84b8.png align="center")

*The trend of the number of Talk and Workshop proposals received over time.*

There is a spike of proposals towards the first deadline, i.e., 5 Aug. Then a slight spike in the final deadline, i.e., 15 Aug.

Initially, I was a bit unhappy that with only three days left, we got around 150 proposals, which is half of the proposals we received in 2019. However, due to aggressive promotion from all the social media handles and local chapters, we received 23 submissions on 4 Aug and 53 proposals ü§Ø on 5 Aug, which was quite overwhelming. However, we could not break the number of proposals milestone of 2019.

### Proposals race üêé

We have received a total of 302 proposals with the following distribution:

* 7 Devsprints proposals
    
* 11 Birds of Features proposals
    
* 14 Lightning Talk proposals
    
* 42 Workshop proposals
    
* 229 Talk proposals
    

Let's see the qualifying rate.

* 35 Talk proposals got shortlisted. This suggests that every proposal has only a 15% (35/229) chance of being shortlisted.
    
* For Workshop proposals, it was 17%. Out of 42, 7 were selected.
    
* For Lightning talks, it was 42%.
    
* For Devsprint, 100% of all proposals were selected.
    

### Proposal review process

Let's break down how the Talk proposals narrowed down over the rounds.

![a line graph showing proposals per round](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1696483014268/c364a1db-d538-4b26-ae50-14dcf4924f58.png align="center")

*Number of Talk proposals qualified across various stages of the review process*

#### 1st round

* We checked the minimum resources on 1st round. Whether the proposals have enough resources to make a fair judgment, which is 3S's:
    
    * Slides (if any)
        
    * Source code, and
        
    * Speaker profile.
        
* We have allowed the submission of proposals till August end. There were medical cases where we made exceptions.
    
* In 2019, we received 280+ proposals and rejected approx. 150 proposals at this stage. My goal was to reduce the rejection to under 50 on this round. We sent repeated reminders like the first reminder after a week, the second after two weeks, then after a month, etc., through Junction. A few proposers notified that they were not getting Emails of Junction comments. Therefore, I have also sent a final reminder email to all the proposers to check their review comments.
    
* Despite all these efforts, 99 proposals were rejected as they had not provided enough materials to review.
    

#### 2nd round

* We have reviewed the remaining 130 proposals three times; through the Junction tools, we made sure a minimum of 3 reviewers should have voted for every proposal.
    
* We have given scores from -2 (lowest) to 3 (highest) for each proposal.
    
* We ran out of time, and due to the lack of a minimum of three reviewers across all categories, we called in for more help and jumped to the 3rd round.
    

#### 3rd round

* As we were short of reviewers, from this round onwards, Core team members and experienced volunteers who have done reviews before joined the CFP team to help us.
    
* In this round, we reviewed the proposals missed in Junction, i.e., with &lt; 3 reviewers votes.
    
* Proposals marked as Promotional were reviewed.
    
* By the end of this round, we ensured that all the 2nd round-qualified proposals were reviewed by at least three reviewers. Then, with all the proposals scored, we went for sorting and further process to 4th round.
    

#### 4th round

* Based on the distribution of the proposals across different categories, a guideline has been prepared to decide how many proposals we should select across each category.
    
    $$Ntsx = Nts * \frac{Nrx}{Nt}$$
    
    Where,  
    Ntsx = Number of proposals to be selected from category x  
    Nts = No of total Talks to be selected for the conference  
    Nrx = Number of proposals received in category x  
    Nt = Total number of proposals received
    
* With the above formula, we have the following guidelines:
    
    | No proposals to be selected | Categories |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | Culture and Society |
    | 4 | Core Python |
    | 1 | Concurrency |
    | 4 | Developer tools and automation |
    | 1 | Ethics and Philosophy |
    | 1 | Scientific Computing |
    | 0 | Game Design and 3D Modelling |
    | 1 | Networking and Security |
    | 3 | Web and app development |
    | 0 | Desktop Applications |
    | 1 | Embedded Python and IOT |
    | 0 | Distributed Computing |
    | 0 | Blockchain |
    | 1 | Cloud Computing |
    | 1 | Others |
    | 9 | Data Science, AI/ML |
    
* This was used as a guideline. All proposals were selected based on their merit. Suppose for a category; the formula was showing 0; if the proposal was highly scored, we selected that adjusting from other categories.
    
* Diversity and First-time speaker preference came into the picture here.
    
* We prepared for the final round.
    

#### 5th and final round

* Later, we got to know that seven more proposals could be selected. We added the seven high-scored proposals to the list.
    
* Two of the speakers from Hyderabad coming to the conference have been shortlisted as standby speakers.
    
* For one last time, we have gone through the final shortlisted Talks.
    

A similar approach was followed for Workshop proposals.

The challenge was that the first two rounds needed to be done continuously in parallel. As the proposals were getting ready for 2nd round of review, I was assigning reviewers experts in that proposal category.

## Tools and Technologies ‚öíÔ∏è

This Section is for you if you are a future PyCon India or any other conference organizer. Thanks to the following tools which helped us make the conference possible.

1. [Junction](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction): A Django-based web application for proposals and reviewer management.
    
2. [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/): A free web and mobile app to start and join meetings.
    
3. [Zoho Mail](https://mail.zoho.in/): A free mailbox to send and receive emails with a custom domain like *cfp@in.pycon.org*, *tickets@in.pycon.org or contact@in.pycon.org*.
    
4. [GitHub Project Manager](https://github.com/orgs/pythonindia/projects/3): We have used the GitHub project manager to manage the workgroup tasks.
    
5. Google Docs: For Agenda, MoM, and further free-flowing text-related documents, we have used Google Docs extensively.
    
6. Google Sheets: We have used Google Sheets extensively from day 1 to manage the proposals, categorize and classify them, etc.
    
7. Google Forms: We have used Google Forms to get reviewer, proposer, and speaker inputs at different phases of the conference.
    
8. [Netlify](https://netlify.com/): We have used Netlify for PR review and our blog and website deployment.
    
9. NextJS: We have used Next.js for the main website.
    
10. [Calendly](https://calendly.com/): For speaker rehearsal slot booking.
    

## Lessons Learnt üìã

In these seven months, I learned many things:

1. I will do it if I have committed to delivering task A, which significantly impacts other human beings. It does not matter if I am getting paid for it or not. It does not matter if I get support from others or not.
    
2. For the CFP workgroup, I tried to manage most of the tasks asynchronously over Zulip and WhatsApp rather than frequent meetings where all participants needed to meet. During the later parts, I made weekly calls and took asynchronous updates from reviewers. Too many synchronous meetings (every participant needs to be there simultaneously) are for people with poor written communication skills, lack of motivation, or less accountability.
    
3. I should have divided the proposals and assigned them to individuals to review rather than asking them to pick up from their preferred category. Often, people want to get specific tasks, and someone else takes care of the bigger picture.
    
4. Time and Energy management across office work, M.Tech, [my other volunteering works](https://www.soumendrak.com/#360146baddc94b1b9d62fa61bfcbe211), and PyCon was challenging. Active prioritization and energy management helped me throughout the journey. This helped during the event days as well.
    
5. Some proposers did not like that their proposal was not selected. One even threatened to complain against me in the Indian ministry. I ignored the threat. Through years of experience in social media and online forums, I have learned where to give my attention.
    
6. The [Junction tool](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction) is not fully matured. After a particular stage in the review process, we were forced to migrate to Google Sheets for proposals and reviewer management. As the only consumer with superuser access in Junction, I will help the Junction lead, Ananyo, to add more features.
    
7. While buying tickets, we could have asked the attendees about the top 3 categories of Talks they wanted to attend, but we missed adding that. That would have made our job easier to select proposals across categories.
    

## Acknowledgment

PyCon India is an entirely volunteer-driven event. Volunteers bring sponsors, volunteers organize, and volunteers even pay for their tickets. The amount of effort and energy a few mad volunteers throw at the conference is remarkable. As a core team member, I observed this energy closely this time.  
This showcases the power of human beings; it is not always motivated by money. A common cause, if inspiring enough, can bring many hands to deck; be it the Indian independence movement or organizing an event, a cause matters. I want to thank the [other workgroup leads](https://web.archive.org/web/20231002020435/https://in.pycon.org/2023/volunteers/workgroup-leads/) and volunteers for doing their responsibilities to make this conference possible.

I am thrilled to extend my heartfelt appreciation to my fantastic co-lead, [Dr. Murali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muralidharan-murugesan-050a4727/), who stepped up and seamlessly took on my duties whenever urgent matters cropped up over seven months.

üéñÔ∏èThanks to the heart and soul of the workgroup, [Aman Pandey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman5319/), [Ashok Tankala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashoktankala), [Koti Vellanki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vellankikoti/), [Mohit Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emhtbnsl/), [Pavan G](https://in.linkedin.com/in/pavan-g-71236420b), and Samir Thakkar, without whom it would not have been possible to review 300+ proposals.

I thank the platform lead, [Ananyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maitiananyo/), who had been resolving all the Junction issues within 24 hours to unblock the CFP team.

‚ú® Special thanks to [Bhanu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhanuk/), Chandan, and [Kalyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyan-prasad-3a647b22/), who stood up when needed.

Finally, I would like to thank the conference chair, [Sanchit Balchandani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inovizz/), for allowing me to lead the CFP workgroup.

## Conclusion

I volunteered for this edition of PyCon for

a) PyCon India is back to the offline conference after a gap of 4 years,  
b) I wouldn't say I liked that PyCon India did not happen last year in 2022 for the first time since its inception in 2009.  
c) There is a high chance that this may be my last PyCon India due to a few personal reasons.

On the days of the event, I have contributed to the registration desk session monitor/chair at various tracks. Maybe I will share those experiences in another post.

In this post, we discussed the overall process of the CFP workgroup since its inception and the challenges faced in between.
