Boosting Go Performance: Understanding Concurrency and Parallelism for Efficient Code Execution

GoLang has built-in support for concurrency and parallelism, making it a great choice for building highly scalable and efficient systems. One of the key features that make this possible is the `go` keyword, which allows you to execute a function in a separate goroutine.

Here's an example:

```go
func main() {
    go doSomething()
    // Do other things in the main goroutine
}

func doSomething() {
    // Do some work
}
```

In this example, the `doSomething` function is executed in a separate goroutine by using the `go` keyword. This means that the `main` function can continue to execute other code without waiting for `doSomething` to finish.

This can be incredibly useful when working with long-running or CPU-intensive tasks, as it allows you to take advantage of all available CPU cores and keep your application responsive. However, it's important to keep in mind that concurrency and parallelism introduce new challenges and complexities, such as data races and deadlocks. So it's important to be familiar with the GoLang concurrency model and best practices for handling these issues.
