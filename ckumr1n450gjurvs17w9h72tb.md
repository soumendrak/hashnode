## Clear the third round for a Lead Engineer

While applying for the Lead Software Engineer positions across various companies from startup unicorns to giant MNCs, FAANG to Big 4 audit companies, I usually dealt with the following set of rounds:

1. Screening round
2. Coding round
3. System design round

Yes, this 3rd round, system design round we will discuss. In the system design round, you will be asked to design a system, mostly in context to the real-world technologies that exist.

## Interview questions

System design interview questions can be divided into two categories:

1. Real-life product based questions
2. An architect concept based questions

### Product based questions

These questions consist of the design aspect of popular tech companies. A few of which I got asked were:


- Design a food delivery system like Zomato or Swiggy
- Design a movie hall ticket booking system like Bookmyshow
- Design a taxi ride-hailing app like Uber or Ola
- Design a social media system like Twitter

### Architecture concept based questions

These are specific questions asked based on architectural concepts which are used in broad system architectures. A few of the questions I got asked were:

- Design a distributed Rate limiter
- Design a distributed Cache
- Create a UUID
- A system is getting slower, how do you find the bottlenecks and how will you resolve those
- How will you design an URL shortener

## Preparations

I have prepared for 3 months consistently for the system design rounds. Initially, I got rejected by multiple companies due to poor performance in this round.
How did I prepare?

- [System design interview](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08B3FWYBX/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_SGSF949GD0HWW3MS4C45) by Alex Xu

- Leetcode [System design discussion](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design?currentPage=1&orderBy=hot&query=)

These helped me to get a grasp of the required materials. Still, there was a long way to go but got basic ideas on common specific questions like:

- Difference between performance and scalability
- Identifying read-heavy and write-heavy systems
- The differences between SQL and NoSQL DBs with their strengths and usages.
- Which NoSQL DB to use under which scenarios.
- When a monolithic application is a good design
- Difference between the load balancer and reverse proxy
- What happens when you type www.google.com
- How to convert an asked question into functional and non-functional requirements
- When simply creating a hash table will solve the issue and many more

You get the idea. All the best.
