## 10 tips to become a better Software Architect

You have joined as a junior developer, coded for 8-15 solid years. Now is the time to choose between two paths: a) Engineering Manager b) Software Architect.

This post is about all skills needed to be a software architect. Let's start.

## 1. Ask the right kind of questions

- Why is this and not that? What is the expertise of the team? What are the trade-offs? Is it the best way to do or is it purely a habit?
- You are not supposed to be told what needs to be done; you are paid to figure out what needs to be done
- Listen to the answers provided to the questions

## 2. Good communication skills

- The ability to bring people to your discussions, interact with them, making your point *without knowing them before*.
- Talking to a computer is easier than talking to people.

## 3. Adaptability

- Have an eye on the new market innovations
- Modify your trade-offs based on the changing business goals
- Also be open-minded to better suggestions

## 4. Prioritization skills

- Prioritise your and others' tasks
- Time management is an essential and evergreen skill

## 8. Pair programming

- By Pair programming, not always two developers, but a BA and a QA
