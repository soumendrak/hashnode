I have been using a MacBook pro since the end of 2019. These are the different apps I use which are super productive for me:

* [Krisp](https://krisp.ai/)
    
    * Krisp’s AI-powered solution removes background noise and echoes from meetings, leaving only a human voice.
        
    * Every day you get **60 minutes** of free noise cancellation from your microphone and speaker.
        
    * It really does noise cancellation well, very well.
        
* [RayCast](https://www.raycast.com/)
    
    * RayCast is your Mac's personal assistant. It is a spotlight on steroids.
        
    * Earlier I was using Alfred. However, the RayCast personal free version provides many more features than the free version of Alfred.
        
* [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/)
    
    * The feature-rich, fast, and free best screenshot tool ever.
        
    * It can annotate, pixelate, measure pixel distance scroll screenshots, and many more.
        
    * You won't regret installing it.
        
* [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)
    
    * I use Thunderbird as my all-in-one email client.
        
* [LanguageTool - Online Grammar, Style & Spell Checker](https://languagetool.org/)
    
    * Alternative to Grammarly: almost all features and cheaper.
        
* [f.lux: software to make your life better (](https://justgetflux.com/)[justgetflux.com](http://justgetflux.com)[)](https://justgetflux.com/)
    
    * Screen color changer for betterment of eyes
        
* [Espanso - A Privacy-first, Cross-platform Text Expander](https://espanso.org/)
    
    * An ultimate productivity tool to save typing characters.
        
* [AppCleaner (](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)[freemacsoft.net](http://freemacsoft.net)[)](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)
    
    * Deletes all residual files from Apps.
