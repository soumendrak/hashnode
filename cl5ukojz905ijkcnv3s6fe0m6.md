## Productive Mac Apps

I have been using a MacBook pro since the end of 2019. These are the different apps I use which are super productive for me:

- [Krisp](https://krisp.ai/)
  - Krispâ€™s AI-powered solution removes background noise and echoes from meetings, leaving only a human voice.
  - Every day you get **60 minutes** of free noise cancellation from your microphone and speaker.
  - It really does noise cancellation well, very well.

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
  - Alfred is your Mac's personal assistant. It is a spotlight on steroids.
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/)
  - The feature-rich, fast, and free best screenshot tool ever.
  - It can annotate, pixelate, measure pixel distance scroll screenshots, and many more.
  - You won't regret installing it.
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)
  - I use Thunderbird as my all-in-one email client.

Other notable Apps:

- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for Video shooting and live streaming
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for note taking
- [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/about/) for Maps and Time Travel
