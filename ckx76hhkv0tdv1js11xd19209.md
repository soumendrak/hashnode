This is a fiction novel. This is my first book review. I will write in two stanzas the first will explain the book and its approach the second will explain the lessons we learn from the book.

This book is about an average girl who suddenly started excelling in everything.
She wants to have fun and excitement in her life.
She had three boyfriends at one point in time and doing great in MBA. Dancing excellent organizing skills got increased. Oration skills increased of her.

Regardless of all these kinds of achievements how she had tried to commit suicide two times. She cannot read a single sentence or letter. The person who was writing 40 pages of letters in a single day could not be able to write a single letter, she simply lost her aspiration to live. Why? This book explained it all. The curious case of a bipolar syndrome patient.

How with proper care she started doing good and came out of the worst phase of her and anybody else in this world's life also itself an inspiration to her and to the readers. It inspired me a lot.
