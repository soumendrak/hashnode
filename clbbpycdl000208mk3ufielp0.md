These are the procedures that can be followed:

1. Identify the issue. Clearly define the problem and gather relevant information, such as error messages or code snippets. Get the logs.
    
2. Break down the issue into smaller, manageable parts. This can help identify the root cause more efficiently and avoid oversimplifying the problem.
    
3. Analyze each part of the issue in turn. For example, use tools such as debugging techniques, breakpoints, and code analysis tools to identify potential causes of the problem.
    
4. Eliminate potential causes that are not related to the problem. This can help narrow the focus and make it easier to pinpoint the root cause.
    
5. Test potential root causes to see if they are the actual cause of the issue. This can involve modifying code or running experiments to see if the problem is resolved.
    
6. Once the root cause is identified, develop a plan to fix the problem. This can involve modifying the code, implementing a new solution, or using a different programming language or framework.
    
7. Implement the solution and test it to ensure the issue is resolved. This can involve running automated tests or manually testing the code to verify that the problem has been fixed.
    
8. Document the root cause analysis and the steps taken to fix the issue. This can help prevent future issues and provide a reference for others who may encounter similar problems. Documentation is a major part of solving issues.
